# <%= userviceName %> Architecture

We encourage you to explain the architecture of this component, avoiding keeping it in a distant place of this project, like in a Google Drive Document. If this project have a wiki, then you can get rid of ARCHITECTURE.md file and address it there.

Try using an image to help people understand it. How to use images:

1. Create an issue in the project and [attach the image(s)](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/) you want to use there. Write something cool and harmless - well this is an issue that is not an issue;

2. Grab the generated URL for the image(s)! In markdown you should see something like `![github-help](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7647451/23706522/4a4b9c8a-03ed-11e7-8077-6b353d3e1836.png)`, which give you this result:

3. Close the issue!!!
