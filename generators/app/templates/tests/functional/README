How to add new functional tests?

  1. Name the test files following the rule:

    <HTTP_METHOD>-<ROUTE_PATH_SEPARATED_BY_->-tests.js

    - Create 1 test file for each route.

    Examples:
      post-users-tests.js
      get-users-{userId}-tests.js

  2. Edit file runner-configs.js to define what tests must be ran:
    - The tests always run in serie
    - Specify the test file name, including the .js extension

  3. To see how to use the framework, just take a look at the examples,
     or see the documentation on functional-framework.js


Executing the tests

  npm run test:functional
  npm run test:functional:debug
